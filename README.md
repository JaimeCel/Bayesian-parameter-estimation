# Bayesian Parameter Estimation of Cosmological Models using MCMC
In this project, we estimate two fundamental parameters in cosmology: the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter.
We employ a Bayesian framework, specifically using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, to infer their most probable values based on observational data.
The notebook walks through defining a model, constructing posterior and proposal functions, and running an MCMC chain to estimate parameters.
